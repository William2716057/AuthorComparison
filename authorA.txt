Three adults and a teenager have been rescued after being spotted clinging to a chilly bin in the ocean near Manu Bay, Raglan.

One of the group was left with critical injuries, another was seriously hurt and the other two had moderate injuries, ambulance staff said.

Coastguard Raglan was alerted to a boat in trouble around 11.21am on Sunday. A volunteer had become concerned the boat hadn’t made it safely across the Raglan Bar, a point of shallow water in the harbour that has strong currents.

“Three adults and a teenager were found clinging to a floating chilly bin and were transported back to shore, where two received immediate medical attention from Hato Hone St John Ambulance crew,” a spokesperson said.

The teenager was transported back to Manu Bay first on a jetski for immediate medical attention before a rescue vessel transported the rest to shore.

The Raglan bar can be dangerous to navigate, and the conditions were “atrocious” on Sunday morning with an outgoing tide and two-metre swell, Coastguard Raglan Gallagher Rescue skipper Lee Poolton said.

“I truly believe that without the Raglan community and someone alerting us about this so quickly, they could still be out there, and we not know. It was that immediate call that made all the difference.”

Poolton said the boat had not been found and was thought to have sunk.

St John said all four were taken to Waikato Hospital.

A police spokesperson said inquiries into the incident were ongoing.
